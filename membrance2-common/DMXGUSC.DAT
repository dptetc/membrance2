# GUS patch mappings.
#
# This is a *terrible* configuration file. I threw it together in an
# hour just so that Freedoom would have a DMXGUS lump. It's based on
# inaccurate stereotypes, ignorance of musical instruments and wild
# guesses. So if you think you can improve it, feel free to do so.
# If you are a musician and are annoyed by this awful configuration
# or the comments within it, YHBT :-)
#
# Designed to use as few patches as possible to fit within a GUS
# with 256K of RAM, but no attempt has been made to improve this for
# the higher configurations!
